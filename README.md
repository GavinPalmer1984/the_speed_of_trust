`How would you describe a low trust organization?`

A low trust organization is unable to accomplish goals.  The reason why organizations do not accomplish goals is resources.  Sometimes the organization doesn't have the financial resources.  Sometimes the ogranization does not have the right skills and knowledge. - Gavin Palmer

`How would you describe a high trust organization?`

A high trust organization is able to accomplish goals and have the resources needed to function properly. - Gavin Palmer

I (Gavin) would rather pose the question: `what do you look for in a company when you are looking for employment?`  One of the first things I look for is whether the company faciltates remote work opportunities when possible.  I find that many companies resist remote work and this is a first sign of incompetance in the organization and should cause distrust.  The second thing I am looking for in a company is salary.  If they are paying small amounts of money then they may simply lack financial resources to hire talent and they may be in a market which is struggling and stressful in general.  I will also pay attention to the hiring process.  A trustworthy company will look for talent who is capable of thinking through problems and solutions with good reasons.  An untrustworthy company will use a timed test which has no relation to real work.  After being hired, a trustworthy company will be composed of team members who are receptive to feedback and who make changes within the organization which correspond to the feedback.  An untrustworthy company will push back on feedback and will not seek improvement of the organization.

> A trusted leader can only exist over the long term in a large organization if there are good myths about him, and particularly about his consistency. - Henk Broeders, Head of Cap Gemini, E&Y for the Netherlands

> Employees treasure the freedom to do their job as they think best, and great employers trust them. - Fortune

> I believe we are the best place in the world to fail (we have plenty of practice!), and failure and invention are inseparable twins.  To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it's going to work, it's not an experiment.  Most organizations embrace the idea of invention, but are not willing to suffer the string of failed experiments to get there. - Jeff Bezos, founder & CEO, Amazon

I (Gavin) think it's a good quote from Jeff who is ultimately not a trustworthy person.

Note that I (Gavin) just reached out to a member of my team to talk about a subject which could impact trust with our customers after I was able to reproduce a reported bug which others said they could not reproduce.

## The Fourth Wave - Market Trust
- The Principle of Reputation

> In virtually every industry, the trusted brand is the most profitable. - Seth Goden, author and marketing expert

```
Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) simplifies the demand/supply system which allows companies to share their product inventory levels with their suppliers.  It only works if the parties trust each other.
```

## The Fifth Wave - Societal Trust
- The Principle of Contribution

```
The Skoll Foundation, whose vision is to "live in a sustainable world of peace and prosperity," has created the Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship (SASE).

Adam Smith, the father of free enterprise and author of "The Theory of Moral Sentiments" and "The Wealth of Nations", taught that "intentional virtue" was foundational to a prosperous economy, and that when a critical mass of people competed for their own best interests within the framework of intentional virtue, there was an "unseen hand" that would guide society in a way that would create prosperity and wealth for all.  During the last part of the twentieth century, however, the "intentional virtue" part somehow got left out.
```

> People talk about businesses needing to be responsible as if it's something new we need to do on top of everything else.  But the whole essence of business should be responsibility.  My philosophy is "We don't run companies to earn profits, we earn profits to run companies."  Our companies need meaning and purpose if they're to fit into the world, or why should they live at all? - Tachi Kiuchi, former managing director, Mitsubishi Electronics

# Inspiring Trust
- How to extend "Smart Trust", restore trust, and take the exponential leap of faith that makes all the difference... and why not extending trust is the greatest risk of all.

## Extending "Smart Trust"

> It is equally an error to trust all men or no man. - Latin proverb

> There is no point in hiring people with specialist knowledge if you are going to monitor their every move.  That is where trust comes in.  People not only have to be trusted to do their jobs.  They have to be able to trust each other.  Successful knowledge work requires collaboration. - Michael Skapinker, Management editor, Financial Times

> Trust, but verify. - Ronald Reagan

## Restoring Trust When It Has Been Lost

> He that cannot forgive others breaks the bridge over which he, too, must pass. - Lord Herbert, British philospoher and theologian

## A Propensity to Trust

> Better trust all and be deceived, and weep that trust, and that deceiving, than doubt one heart that, if believed had blessed one's life with true believing. - Frances Anne Kemble, British writer
